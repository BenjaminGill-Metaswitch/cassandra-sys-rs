# cassandra-sys
This is the source for the cassandra-sys crate on crates.io.

It is mostly an autogenerated wrapper around the DataStax C++ CQL driver.

It also includes a fairly complete set of examples equivalent to the ones in the C++ repository.

It is quite possible to use this crate directly from your rust code, but it will mean littering unsafe all over the place.

Instead it is recommended that you use the safe wrapper of this ffi interface.
